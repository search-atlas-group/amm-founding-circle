# Launch Website — Search Atlas Website Launch Planner

Turn discovery inputs (URL, services, locations) into a complete pre-launch plan: site
architecture, per-page briefs with primary + long-tail keywords, metadata, modules, FAQs,
schemas and internal linking — grounded in real Search Atlas data.

**Scope:** local service businesses with **1–5 physical locations**. Not national
franchises. A franchise's page strategy assumes brand demand an independent does not
have; copying it produces a site that ranks for nothing.

## Two rules that override everything else

1. **Never publish a number you did not pull from a tool.** Ratings, review counts,
   licence numbers, years in business, job counts, awards, competitor metrics. If it is
   not sourced, it does not go in the plan — not as an example, not as a placeholder that
   looks like data. See `spec/master-template-spec.md` §5.
2. **Never generate a page just because a keyword exists.** Search volume is not a
   publish gate. Evidence is. See Phase 3.

Both exist because the failure mode of this skill is a plan that *looks* researched. A
partner cannot tell an invented volume from a real one by reading it.

## Prerequisites

The `searchatlas` MCP server must be connected. If `mcp__searchatlas__*` tools are not
available, stop and tell the user to add it (`https://mcp.searchatlas.com/mcp`).

Tool names in this skill are verified against `qa/tool_manifest.json`. **If you are
editing this skill, run `qa/lint_skill_tools.py` before you finish.** v0.3 shipped 52
tool names that did not exist on the server, which silently broke keyword research, FAQ
sourcing, citations and tracking. Do not add a tool name from memory.

---

## Phase 0 — Identify target

> Which domain do you want to plan a launch for? (paste a URL, or type `list` to pick from your account)

`list` → `otto_list_projects`, present a numbered menu.

Capture `domain`, `client_slug`. If the argument hint contains a URL, pre-fill and skip.

## Phase 0.5 — Existence check + pillar scores

Run in parallel. **Discover only — create nothing yet.** Each lookup fails soft.

| Tool | Purpose | Capture |
|---|---|---|
| `otto_find_project_by_hostname` | OTTO project | `otto_project_id` + engagement status |
| `bv_list` (filter by domain) | Brand vault | `brand_vault_uuid` |
| `gbp_list_locations` | GBP locations | **every** `gbp_location_id` — this drives the sitemap |
| `ppc_list_businesses` | PPC business | `ppc_business_id` |
| `llmv_list_projects` | LLM Visibility | `llmv_project_id` |

If `otto_project_id` exists, also pull `se_get_holistic_seo_scores` (Technical · Content ·
Authority · UX, 0–100).

```
🔍 Existence check for {domain}:
   🏗️  OTTO project       {emoji} {exists/missing}  [id]
   🏷️  Brand vault        {emoji} {exists/missing}  [uuid]
   📍  GBP locations      {emoji} {N found}         [ids]
   💰  PPC business       {emoji} {exists/missing}  [id]
   👁️  LLM Visibility     {emoji} {exists/missing}  [id]

   Pillar scores (if OTTO project exists):
   Technical    {N}/100   {bar}
   Content      {N}/100   {bar}
   Authority    {N}/100   {bar}
   UX           {N}/100   {bar}
```

**Pillar scores reorder the Phase 10 playbook:**
- Authority < 40 → front-load PR / Digital PR / Link Listings to month 1
- Content < 50 → topical map + article generation become week-2, not week-4
- Technical < 60 → run `otto_audit_site` **before** the build, not at launch
- UX < 60 → flag in Open Questions as a redesign scope beyond content

## Phase 1 — Brand vault auto-pull, or manual collection

### Path A — vault exists

| Tool | Captures |
|---|---|
| `bv_get_details` | Name, domain, logo, colors, description, business profile |
| `bv_get_sources` | **What the vault was built from** — decides how much to trust it |
| `bv_list_voice_templates` | Tone / style templates |
| `kg_get` or `otto_get_knowledge_graph` | Entities, topic clusters, competitors |

Show the pulled data and ask `yes / edit [field]`. Edits push back via
`bv_update_profile` (business info, name, description, colors) or `bv_update_ai_settings`
(voice). There is one profile-update tool, not a family of field-specific ones.

**Trust grading.** `bv_get_sources` tells you whether a value came from a human, a
document upload, or an auto-crawl of the client's old website. An auto-crawled value is
an input to confirm, not a fact to publish — and the old site is exactly the janky,
out-of-date artifact being replaced.

### Path B — no vault

Collect via `AskUserQuestion`:

**Required:** `business_name` · `domain` · `services` · `primary_location` ·
**`location_count`** (how many physical locations with their own address, 1–5)

**Optional:** `service_areas` · `competitors` · `vertical`

If the site is live, `WebFetch` or `web_scrape` the homepage to pre-fill candidates for
the user to confirm.

Then offer: *"Want me to create a Search Atlas brand vault for {domain} so this data is
reusable?"* → `bv_create`.

### Required-for-publish inputs

These are not optional and the plan says so explicitly when they are missing. Per
`spec/master-template-spec.md` §5, absent identity/legal/licensing data is a **hard fail**,
not a silently omitted block:

- Legal business name, exact NAP per location, licence number(s) + issuing state
- Insurance status, service capability per service line
- Booking/form endpoint, or an explicit "phone only" decision
- Review source (which GBP location each rating is pulled from)

## Phase 2 — Keyword & market research

Check `get_balance` first and surface it.

**Batch, don't loop.** One `se_research_keywords` call takes up to 200 keywords and
returns volume, difficulty and CPC inline. Build the seed list first — services ×
locations, plus `"{service} near me"`, `"{service} cost"`, `"emergency {service}"`,
`"{vertical} {city}"` — then make one call. Use `se_lookup_keyword` for one-off checks.

**Scope the volume.** Both tools take an optional `location_id`. National volume for
"water heater repair" tells you nothing about a Fairfax plumber. Either scope it or label
the number `national` in the plan.

**Intent comes free.** `se_lookup_keyword` returns search intent and related keywords in
the same response. There is no separate intent tool.

**Competitor keyword expansion (optional, gated):** `se_create_project` on a competitor
domain → `se_get_organic` with `views=["competitors","keywords","pages"]`. This creates a
Site Explorer project per domain, so cap at the top 2. Note that a Site Explorer `site_id`
is **not** a keyword-research `project_id`.

Deduplicate, score by volume × intent weight, group by service. Hold as `keyword_bank`.

> **There is no People-Also-Ask endpoint on this MCP.** Do not plan around one. FAQ
> sourcing is handled explicitly in Phase 5.

## Phase 2.5 — Local competitor identification

**`WebSearch` first** — pass the non-competitor blocklist from
`references/searchatlas-playbook.md` to `blocked_domains` so review sites, aggregators,
directories and social are filtered server-side. Parse hostnames, dedupe, top 3 distinct
per query. Run for the head term and per location.

Fallbacks: `AskUserQuestion` for 3–5 known competitors → "competitor research deferred"
with a next step. **Never invent a competitor domain, and never state a competitor's DA,
rating or review count unless a tool returned it.**

Keep national franchises in a separate `national` bucket — they are reference, not the
competitive set.

Feeds **Section 3 of the plan: Local Competitive Landscape.**

## Phase 3 — Site architecture

Derive the sitemap from evidence, not from a fixed skeleton. Full rules in
`spec/sitemap-rules.md`; the logic:

```
/                                  Home — always
/services/                         Services hub — always
/services/{service-slug}/          One per service the client actually performs
/locations/{city}/                 One per PHYSICAL location (own GBP + address)
/service-areas/                    One page listing every city covered
/emergency/                        Only if the client genuinely dispatches 24/7
/about/  /contact/  /reviews/  /faq/
/blog/  /blog/{post-slug}/
```

**The location rule.** A `/locations/{city}/` page requires a **physical location with its
own GBP listing** — its own address, hours, phone, review stream and `Plumber` `@id`.

A city the business merely covers is a **row on `/service-areas/`** and plain text in the
areas-we-serve band. It does not get a page. It graduates to one only when materially
distinct verified evidence exists: real jobs there, a real response-time commitment, real
local reviews, a genuine service constraint.

Generating 10–20 near-identical city pages by substituting names is scaled content abuse
under Google's spam policies, and in an agency model that repeats across hundreds of
clients it is the single largest risk in the whole product. **Search volume is not a
justification.** If the user pushes for volume-driven city pages, say what the risk is
and let them decide — do not generate them silently.

**Hidden-address locations.** If `gbp_get_location` reports the address is hidden, that
location's page renders a coverage map and **no street address anywhere** — not in the
body, not in the footer, not in schema.

Enrich blog seeds with `cg_topic_suggestions` (cap 5). Recommend `cg_create_topical_map`
natively rather than auto-creating — the UI flow is multi-step and better in-app.

## Phase 4 — Brand voice + Knowledge Graph

Recommend, do not auto-create: `bv_create` (voice questionnaire), `kg_create`
(Organization + one `LocalBusiness`/`Plumber` node **per physical location**). Read back
with `kg_get` and check against the spec's required-entity list — there is no
completeness-scoring tool.

## Phase 5 — Per-page briefs

Per page: primary keyword · 2 long-tails · metadata · modules · FAQs · schemas · internal
links · **and the template that renders it** (`templates/{name}.html`).

**Metadata.** Title validated by **rendered pixel width**, not character count — a
60-character title of wide glyphs truncates where a 68-character one does not. Title, H1,
canonical and body must agree on **one** primary target. Secondary geographic mentions are
fine; contradiction is the defect.

**Modules** from `references/page-types.md`.

**FAQs — generate candidates, then validate against volume.** There is no PAA endpoint on
this MCP, and **related keywords are not a substitute** — verified on 2026-08-14, they
return near-duplicate variants ("plumb near me", "plumber near near me"), not questions.
Discovery is observational; validation is metric-backed:

| Step | Method | Tag |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Generate candidates | Trade knowledge + the questions competitors answer (`WebSearch` the head term, read their FAQ blocks) | — |
| 2. Validate | Batch the candidates through `se_research_keywords` and keep the ones with real volume | `validated` |
| 3. Keep unvalidated but useful | Question a customer genuinely asks that returns no volume | `observed` |
| 4. Company / service-area | Filled from the brand record — licences, hours, trip fees, coverage | `template` |

Every FAQ in the plan carries its tag and, for `validated`, its volume. This works: in the
Fairfax grading run, *"why is my water heater leaking"* returned **1,900/mo** and *"how
much does it cost to replace a water heater"* **2,400/mo**.

**Do not treat a single 0-volume result as proof of no demand** — the same run returned
0 for "how long does a water heater last" while assigning it a difficulty score of 27,
which is internally inconsistent. Cross-check anything surprising.

Per-page targets live in `references/page-types.md` (blog post 0–4 · contact 2–3 · home and about 3–5 · hub and location 4–6 · service 4–8 · the FAQ hub consolidates). **Stop when the good ones run out.** v0.3 said
"if PAA data is thin, supplement to reach 8–12" — that instruction manufactures padding.
Six sourced questions beat twelve invented ones. Home and hub pages skew to company and
service-area questions; service pages skew to service questions; location pages skew to
coverage questions.

**Headings outlines (gated, generation-class).** `cg_create_content_instance` +
`cg_run_generation_step` + `cg_update_article_headings`, homepage and top 3 service pages
only, **after asking the user** — these cost more than lookups. Everything else: "run
headings natively post-launch."

## Phase 6 — Schema deployment plan

Compile the per-page matrix from `references/page-types.md`. Document the sequence; do not
auto-deploy:

1. `otto_audit_site` — project ready
2. `otto_set_engagement` — activate
3. `otto_generate_page_schema` per page
4. `otto_deploy_schema` — push live (one tool covers page and sitewide)
5. `otto_list_schemas` — verify

**Honesty rules.** Schema only for content visible and accurate on the page. One
`Plumber` entity per physical location, cross-referenced by `@id` — not one per city name.
Self-serving `aggregateRating` and FAQ rich results are both heavily restricted; treat
`Service` / `FAQPage` / `BreadcrumbList` as machine-readable metadata, not a ranking
tactic, and make no promises about star results.

## Phase 7 — Internal linking map

Apply `references/internal-linking.md`. Output as a table: source → target → anchor →
module. Service-area cities that have no page get **plain text, not links** — this is what
makes the doorway-page guard visible in the markup instead of buried in prose.

## Phase 8 — Local SEO layer

Output `references/local-seo-layer.md` as a numbered checklist, **per location**. Note
that `local_seo_heatmaps_recommend_keywords` requires a `business_id` from
`local_seo_heatmaps_create_business` — it belongs here, not in Phase 2.

## Phase 9 — Tracking setup

- `krt_create_project` + `krt_add_keywords` — seed with Phase 2 primaries
- `gsc_get_sites` (NATIVE, OAuth) + `otto_manage_gsc_property` to bind it
- `llmv_create_project` + `llmv_add_topics` + `llmv_add_queries` (plural)
- `otto_audit_site` → `otto_set_engagement`
- **Call tracking and attribution** — `spec/measurement.md`. The phone is the primary
  channel for a trade; a site measuring only the form measures the wrong half. Record the
  DNI mode and the NAP strategy before launch, because tracking numbers and NAP
  consistency genuinely conflict.
- **Failure monitoring on both channels.** A form that silently stops capturing is
  invisible; so is a tracked number that stops recording, which produces silence that
  looks like a quiet week. Launch-day requirements, not nice-to-haves.

## Phase 10 — Authority / promotional (post-launch)

`pr_create` + `pr_publish` (`pr_get_publish_options` for tiers) · `dpr_create_campaign` ·
`social_hub_create_project` (`social_hub_manage_accounts` for OAuth) · `ll_manage_project`
(`ll_list_publications` to browse).

## Example

`examples/goswiftpro-fairfax/` — a real graded run against a live Northern Virginia
plumber. Every number in it carries its source, and the run notes record what the tools
returned versus what had to be deferred.

The previous worked example (`plumbing-vegas`) was a fully invented business with invented
volumes and competitor scores, presented as a calibration reference. It was removed: a
model calibrating on it reproduces the shape *including* the confident fake numbers.

## Out of scope

- Auto-writing page content (use the Content Generator natively)
- Auto-deploying schemas (the plan documents the commands)
- E-commerce, national-scope sites, franchises with >5 locations
- Multi-language / international SEO
